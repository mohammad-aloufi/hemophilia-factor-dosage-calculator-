# Introduction

hemophilia is an inherited blood disorder where the blood doesn't clot properly. That means if a person with Hemophilia has an episode of bleeding, it's unlikely to stop specially if it was a deep wound without an emergency intervention.

A person with Hemophilia is more likely to get internal bleedings and joint bleedings.

# What is this project about?

People with Hemophilia need to go to the ER from time to time to get Factor viii or Factor ix, depending on which type of Hemophilia they're diagnosed with, the dose they need is dependent on a few factors like their weight, the Hemophilia type and the blood factor level they want to reach after taking the dose.

So I made this little script where I can just input my data and get the amount of dose I need and thought I push it here because maybe someone else might find this helpfull.

# How to use

Just run the script, and it'll ask you for the data needed to give you the result. It'll ask you if you need to do another calculation or not.

# Installation

You just need the latest version of python to run this, no additional libraries needed.

# Note

This isn't in any way, shape or form a prescription of any kind. Always refer to your doctor when it comes to the factor viii or factor ix dose you need. This script is strictly for informational purposes only.

*All results are estimates. Do not rely on the results you get from the script in this repository in any way for any medical advice or diagnosis.*
